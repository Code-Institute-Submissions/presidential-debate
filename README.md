# Presidential Debate

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

Amiresponsive photo

_Presidential Debate_ is a satirical memory game that pits the player against the computer, challenging them to repeat the increasingly complicated patterns with an amusing political twist. I wanted to develop my JavaScript skills by designing a "Bop-It" program and, after watching the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, thought a fun variation on the classic game would be to replace the standard "Bop-It" noises with soundbites of the two candidates shouting at each other.

This was the second of four Milestone Projects required to pass the Full Stack Web Development Program at _Code Institute_. The main requirements were to build an interactive front-end site which responds to the users' actions using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

## UX Design
### User stories
I started the design process for _Presidential Debate_ by considering the goals of the site owner (me) and the site users (new players and returning players).

**Site owner**
1. As the site owner, I want the site users to enjoy playing the game so that the game becomes popular.
2. As the site owner, I want the website to be aesthetically pleasing to demonstrate my ability to code in HTML and CSS and to create a positive UX experience for the site users.
3. As the site owner, I want the game to function well to demonstrate my ability to code in JavaScript and JQuery and to create a positive UX experience for the site users.

**Site users**
1. As a site user, I want to enjoy playing the game.
2. As a site user, I want the game to load quickly and not lag so I am not distracted from playing the game.
3. As a site user, I want to receive visual and audio feedback when I play the game correctly so I know what I've done right.
4. As a site user, I want to receive visual and audio feedback when I play the game incorrectly so I know that I've made a mistake.
5. As a site user, I want to be able to turn the sound on and off depending on my surroundings.
6. As a new site user, I want the website to be easy to navigate so I can find the game and the instructions quickly.
7. As a new site user, I want clear instructions on how the game works so I can start playing quickly.
8. As a new site user, I want to be able to select an easy difficulty so I can get the hang of the game.
9. As a returning site user, I want to be able to select a harder difficulty so I can challenge myself and score more points.
10. As a returning site user, I want to be able to see my high score so I can try to beat it.

### Design Process

1. **Strategy plane:** My primary aim for this project was to create an aesthetically pleasing game with an amusing political twist that would entertain a wide range of users. My secondary aim was to build upon the HTML and CSS3 skills I had learnt in the first section of the _Code Institute_ course content, and develop the JavaScript and JQuery skills I had learnt in the second section. ADD MORE

2. **Scope plane:** After establishing the main aims of this project, I started looking for inspiration in similar games that already existed. I found these previous _Code Institue_ MS2 projects particularly helpful:
- [Memory Game by shaamuus](https://shaamuus.github.io/milestone-project-2/)
- [TWUFO by matthewyong](https://matthewyong.github.io/twufo/index.html)
- [Bop It! by hschafer2017](https://hschafer2017.github.io/Stream-Two-Project/)

These other pages were also userful:

- [Bop It! by GreenSock](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/YVJVzW)

## Deployment

I used GitHub Pages to deploy my website with the following steps:

1. I opened _Settings_ on my project repository in GitHub.
2. I then scrolled to _GitHub Pages_.
3. I selected the _master branch_ as my source.
4. This deployed my project on GitHub Pages and allowed me to share the live website.

More information on Github Pages can be found [here](https://pages.github.com/).

## Cloning

To develop my project further you can clone it to your local machine with the following steps:

1. Scroll to the top of my repository and click on the _Clone or download_ button.
2. Decide whether you want to clone the project using HTTPS or an SSH key.
  1. For HTTPS: click on the checklist icon to the right of the URL.
  2. For SSH key: first click on 'Use SSH' then click on the checklist icon to the right of the URL.
3. Open the _Terminal._
4. Change the current working directory to the destination of the cloned directory.
5. Type "git clone" and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
6. Press _Enter_ to create your local clone.
