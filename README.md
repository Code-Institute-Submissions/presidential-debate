## Deployment

I used GitHub Pages to deploy my website with the following steps:

1. I opened _Settings_ on my project repository in GitHub.
2. I then scrolled to _GitHub Pages_.
3. I selected the _master branch_ as my source.
4. This deployed my project on GitHub Pages and allowed me to share the live website.

More information on Github Pages can be found [here](https://pages.github.com/).

## Cloning

To develop my project further you can clone it to your local machine with the following steps:

1. Scroll to the top of my repository and click on the _Clone or download_ button.
2. Decide whether you want to clone the project using HTTPS or an SSH key.
  1. For HTTPS: click on the checklist icon to the right of the URL.
  2. For SSH key: first click on 'Use SSH' then click on the checklist icon to the right of the URL.
3. Open the _Terminal._
4. Change the current working directory to the destination of the cloned directory.
5. Type "git clone" and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
6. Press _Enter_ to create your local clone.
